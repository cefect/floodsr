floodsr Documentation
=====================

Welcome to the starter docs for ``floodsr``.

This is a single-page ``.rst`` baseline you can expand as modules, workflows,
and model details are formalized.

Quick Start
-----------

1. Build and open the docs container from ``docs/.devcontainer``.
2. Edit this file: ``docs/index.rst``.
3. Build HTML:

.. code-block:: bash

   sphinx-build -b html . _build/html

4. Open ``docs/_build/html/index.html``.

Roadmap
-------

- Add API docs once the Python package structure is stable.
- Add usage tutorials for CLI workflows.
- Add model registry and deployment notes.
