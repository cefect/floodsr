# ADR: buildings data

Candidate data sets (see `c:\GD\04_LIB\data_cats\_DataCatalog - type.xlsx`):
- Microsoft buidlings: need to check
- OpenStreetMap: maybe
- StatsCan Open Database of Buildings: only covers cities. big zip file per province. not ideal.
- NRCan - Automatically Extracted Buildings: seems to be a sub-set of HRDEM coverage (makes sense.. probably same source LIDAR). but <0.5 the coverage of southern canada.  **lets use this one**
